Just another repository

Jonny Tatt here. I am an aspiring programmer in the last year of my BSIT. I always appreciate any help, especially in with Java programming which is what I am working at currently. I just built my first computer for myself finally at 35 years old and unfortunately lost a lot of good programs that were installed on my very slow laptop, so I am still working at recovering what I can from the internet. I like learning studying malware and ransomware, busting scammers and hacking. Thats about it.
